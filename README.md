# WiDS Datathon 2023
This repository contains the code and data for my group submission to the WiDS Datathon 2023. The challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict extreme weather events.
<p>The dataset contains weather data from 1981 to 2022. The target variable is the occurrence of an extreme weather event.
We used a variety of machine learning algorithms to train my model, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM. I also used feature engineering to improve the performance of my model.</p>
<p>Our best model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. This repository is still under development, but I plan to add more information and documentation in the future.</p>

# The repository is organized as follows:
*<p><b>data/</b>: contains the dataset used for the challenge.</p>
*<p><b>models/</b>: contains the code for the machine learning models.</p>
<p><b>notebooks/</b>: contains the Jupyter notebooks used to develop and evaluate the models.</p>
<p><b>README.md</b> this file, which provides an overview of the repository.</p>

# To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:
<p>git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/widsdatathon2023.git</p>
<p>cd widsdatathon2023</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>

<p><b>Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter notebooks to develop and evaluate the models.</b></p>
I hope this helps!
